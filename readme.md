# Clothify- an E-Commerce Website

## Description
This GitHub project showcases a fashion e-commerce website developed as part of my web development portfolio. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the website offers a seamless shopping experience for clothing enthusiasts. Features include a user-friendly interface, product browsing with categories, secure authentication, and a responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices. Explore the code to see how I implemented features like adding items to the cart, managing user sessions, and integrating with a backend database. Whether you're a developer seeking inspiration or a fashion enthusiast interested in the tech behind the scenes, this project provides valuable insights into modern web development practices.
